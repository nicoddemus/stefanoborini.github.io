title: Doing nothing in bash
---

Today I had to \"do nothing\" in bash. In python you have \"pass\" for
this task. In C, you can use \";\". I found [this
post](http://ynniv.com/blog/2005/04/doing-nothing-in-bash.html) from
someone having the same issue. He proposes either \"sleep 0\" or
\"A=0\". However, looks like this is even nicer: from the bash manual

> : \[arguments\]

So, a simple \":\" will do the trick.
